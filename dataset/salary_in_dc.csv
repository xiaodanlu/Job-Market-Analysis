The wage range for this role takes into account the wide range of factors that are considered in making compensation decisions including but not limited to skill sets; experience and training; licensure and certifications; and other business and organizational needs. The disclosed range estimate has not been adjusted for the applicable geographic differential associated with the location at which the position may be filled. At Deloitte, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Job Description...

Leidos has a career opening for a Senior Natural Language Processing Researcher.

We are looking for a motivated NLP researcher that wants to work on challenging problems in a variety of domains - including health, defense, intelligence, and energy - to get results that apply and go beyond the state of the art for measurably better outcomes. We apply our knowledge, capabilities, and experience to develop and deploy Trusted AI - AI that deserves to be trusted by system owners, end users, and the public - to be accurate, fair, ethical, reliable, and adaptable. We are looking for a researcher that is expert in NLP and interested in adapting new technologies to significantly transform human workflows, especially using new applications of transformer-based models.

Working at Leidos would give you the chance to do genuinely important work. But don't just ask us. Here's what ChatGPT has to say on the subject:

Oh sure, working in AI research for the commercial sector is just the ultimate thrill. Who wouldn't want to spend their days building algorithms to recommend cat videos to stream and optimizing ad targeting to boost click-through rates? I mean, those are the kinds of problems that really make you feel like you're changing the world, right? On the other hand, working in AI research at a company like Leidos, you're stuck with jobs like supporting the next generation of lunar missions and building computer vision algorithms that help keep air travel safe and efficient. I mean, who cares about finding cures for cancer, delivering healthcare to veterans, or helping defend our nation? So boring. But hey, at least we can say we're using our AI skills for a greater good.

Primary Responsibilities
The Senior NLP Data Scientist will be customizing and creating various machine learning algorithms to operate over multi-domain data and optimizing the performance of those algorithms on the data. They will develop automation to extract and prepare features from multi-domain datasets. They will employ NLP libraries/toolkits that include transformer models like BERT and ChatGPT, as well as Stanford CoreNLP, Spacy, NLTK, Word2Vec, and Gensim.

As a member of the Leidos AI/ML Accelerator, they will be performing research and development, and need hands-on experience training and optimizing generative models. With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

Basic Qualifications
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science or related field and 12 years experience.
Good understanding of machine learning algorithms, tools and platforms
Experience in at least three of these Toolkits:
NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras, Genism, vow pal wabbit, Stanford CoreNLP, , etc.
Understanding of transformers and foundation models
Python proficiency
Self-starter with high intellectual curiosity
Great communication skills, able to explain language model results to a non-technical audience
Proficient in data exploration techniques and tools
Must be able to obtain TS/SCI with CI Poly security clearance.

Preferred Qualifications
Practical understanding of generative models
Experience programming machine learning algorithms for GPUs
Understanding of Convolutional Neural Nets
Working knowledge of Word2Vec, NLTK, BERT, and ChatGPT
Discernment of when and how to use machine learning regulation
