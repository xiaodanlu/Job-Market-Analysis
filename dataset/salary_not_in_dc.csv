The Cryptops Exchange uses asset tokenization to provide an intuitive, secure and censorship resistant method for trading crypto currency option derivatives directly on blockchain. Cryptops is currently... the only decentralized exchange that uses asset tokenization to issue traditional financial derivatives directly to an on-blockchain order book.

Other decentralized derivatives exchanges require users to install web browser plugins in order to ""connect"" to a hybrid off-chain order book to place orders and make trades. This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various ""hacks"", ""exploits"" and ""vulnerabilities"". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.

Some unique benefits of the Cryptops project.
• The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.
• The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.
• The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together...

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Modeler within the Risk Machine Learning and Decision Science team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on transfer learning, reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, natural language processing, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

We are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Senior Machine Learning Modeler to join the Payment credit risk team. The successful candidate will lead the development and maintenance of predictive models that drive our credit risk strategies, and will work closely with stakeholders to ensure optimal credit risk management. The successful candidate will play a crucial role in developing and executing the team's roadmap and long term strategy for payment credit risk modeling, and will be responsible for hands-on building and maintaining predictive ML models that drive our credit risk strategies. You are not only an executor but also a visionary leader to drive business and team growth.

You will:

Build machine learning/deep learning models for payment credit risk assessment that analyze seller / payment activity in real time / batch across Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and debit card products.
• Stay up-to-date with industry trends and advancements in machine learning techniques and share/lead the team for learning/improvement. Adapt existing machine learning methods and transfer learning to develop solutions that work at global scale.
• A senior data / ML leader provides short/long term machine learning strategy, scales the scope of work and team, making recommendations that lead to e2e execution.
• Leverage an experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to create preventative systems, collaborate on new product features to drive business growth and payment losses reduction, and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for our models.
• Lead and collaborate with other data scientists, data analysts, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

Qualifications

You have:

Anyscale provides a development platform intended to simplify distributed computing. This enables software developers of all skill levels to build applications that run at any scale from a laptop to the data center...

We're commercializing a popular open source project called Ray - which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

Our goal is to enable organizations to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world and at lower cost. Backed by Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

Anyscale is based in San Francisco, CA.

About the role:

Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:

The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including RaySGD (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
• Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
• Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
• Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
• Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning

We'd love to hear from you if you have:
• Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
• Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)

Bonus points!
• Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
• Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
• Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
• Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
• At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.
• * This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:
• * Stock Options
• Healthcare plans, with premiums covered by Anyscale at 99%
• 401k Retirement Plan
• Wellness stipend
• Education stipend
• Paid Parental Leave
• Paid Time Off
• Commute reimbursement
• 100% of in office meals covered
