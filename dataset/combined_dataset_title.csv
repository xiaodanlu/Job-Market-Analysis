EigenLabs is the team behind EigenLayer, which provides crypto economic security as a service for proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain modules, such as rollups, bridges, oracles, and Dapps. In today's blockchain ecosystem, each service is typically secured by its own token. The difficulty of bootstrapping new tokens often leads to too little capital to secure their services... sufficiently. With EigenLayer, blockchain services can rely on Ethereum for security instead of the value of their own token values. Stakers in the Ethereum proof-of-stake network can ""re-stake"" their assets with EigenLayer to secure other services and earn higher returns. Customers pay transaction fees for these strong security guarantees, making it possible for anyone to build innovative blockchain modules without large upfront capital costs.

Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

In recent years, the AI landscape has been transformed by the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models. The advances of such models truly transform what’s possible in terms of performance, capabilities, and applications. However, it also introduces challenges in energy consumption, adapting the models to new tasks and changing environments, and ensuring that the AI we develop helps people accomplish their goals.

Our research is focused on two interconnected aims— motivated by the practical challenges presented by large-scale AI and inspired by the amazing things that our human intelligence... does so well:

Adaptability:We strive to develop AI that is adaptable across a broad range of previously unseen environments and tasks and developing methods for interacting with AI models to achieve outcomes that match our intent.

Efficiency: Scale has been enabling the models to reach new heights in capabilities but also made them expensive to use and deploy. We aim to create AI systems that can smoothly scale to fit any computational footprint, from the cloud to the edge.

We are seeking candidates for several internship positions with experience in natural language processing and deep learning.

reinforcement-learning,"Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Modeling), Risk",Block,"  San Francisco, CA   ",SmartRecruiters Job Search,"Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together...

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Job Description

As a Machine Learning Modeler within the Risk Machine Learning and Decision Science team, you work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on transfer learning, reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, natural language processing, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

The successful candidate will lead the development and maintenance of predictive models that drive our credit risk strategies, and will work closely with stakeholders to ensure optimal credit risk management. The successful candidate will play a crucial role in developing and executing the team's roadmap and long term strategy for payment credit risk modeling, and will be responsible for hands-on building and maintaining predictive ML models that drive our credit risk strategies. You are not only an executor but also a visionary leader to drive business and team growth.

You will:

Build machine learning/deep learning models for payment credit risk assessment that analyze seller / payment activity in real time / batch across Seller’s ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and debit card products.
• Stay up-to-date with industry trends and advancements in machine learning techniques and share/lead the team for learning/improvement. Adapt existing machine learning methods and transfer learning to develop solutions that work at global scale.
• A senior data / ML leader provides short/long term machine learning strategy, scales the scope of work and team, making recommendations that lead to e2e execution.
• Leverage an experimentation mindset along with state-of-the-art algorithms to create preventative systems, collaborate on new product features to drive business growth and payment losses reduction, and explore new datasets (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for our models.
• Lead and collaborate with other data scientists, data analysts, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:

The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including RaySGD (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
• Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
• Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
• Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
• Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning

We'd love to hear from you if you have:
• Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
• Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)

Bonus points!
• Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
• Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
• Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
• Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
• At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.
• * This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:
• * Stock Options
• Healthcare plans, with premiums covered by Anyscale at 99%
• 401k Retirement Plan
• Wellness stipend
• Education stipend

Theory

Description

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD student to join our research team at University of
Artois - LGI2A - Decision and Information Fusion theme (DFI) - Béthune - France -
(https://www.lgi2a.univ-artois.fr/spip/en/) focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in deep neural networks using Dempster Shafer theory of evidence. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects and collaborate with other researchers in the field.

Subject

Deep neural networks (DNNs) refer to predictive models that exploit multiple layers of artificial neurons to compute a prediction [1,4]. In the original version, the layers are sequential and each neuron in a layer is connected with neurons in the previous layer. Many other alternative architectures have been proposed to adapt DNNs to solve specific and complex problems.

On the other hand, a theory called Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, or theory of evidence
[15], has emerged as a rich and flexible generalization of the Bayesian probability theory, able to deal with imperfect (uncertain, imprecise, …) information. It is notably used in a growing number of applications such as classification (e.g. [2]), clustering (e.g. [3,7]) or information fusion (e.g. [5,13]).

Recent works [6,16,17] have shown the interest of enriching a DNN with an additional distance-based
Dempster Shafer layer [2] for predicting belief functions. These belief functions can be of great interest to represent a reality as faithfully as possible, for example to perform a partial classification [8], i.e. decisions in favor of a group of classes.

The main idea of this thesis is to develop such deep evidential networks in more depth by exploiting methods developed at LGI2A allowing one to consider finer knowledge about the quality [12, 14] and the dependence of information [11], or the ignorance in predictions [9,10].

Two applications are envisaged: Image analysis from drones and fish population analysis.

New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to... discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL.

Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees, yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware, and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. The postdocs at JPL benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California.

The Radar Science and Engineering section at JPL is looking for a postdoc to develop, implement, and test new algorithms to be adopted by the Observational Products for End-users using Remote sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to generate surface displacement products over North America.

The postdoc will help develop new ionosphere phase estimation and phase unwrapping algorithms to correct and improve the accuracy of remote sensing products derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The suitable candidate will also contribute to the verification of the displacement time-series algorithm over representative regions in North America covered by the OPERA displacement product.

The postdoc will contribute to:

• Develop and implement a new algorithm for correcting the ionosphere phase screen affecting InSAR time-series data using Total Electron Content maps derived from dual-frequency GNSS data.

• Test and quantify the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm on time series of C-band (e.g., Sentinel-1A/B) and L-band (e.g., NISAR) InSAR data and compare its performance with that from state-of-the-art methods (e.g., split-spectrum).

• Improve state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms to reduce unwrapping errors and computational runtime for fine resolution wrapped interferograms.

• Verify the selected OPERA’s surface displacement algorithm over North America with a focus on regions affected by significant temporal decorrelation changes (e.g., areas with snowfall).

• Publish outcomes in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.

The outcome of this investigation will inform the OPERA project algorithm development team on the ionosphere phase correction algorithm to adopt for generating OPERA displacement products.

Qualifications:

Applicants may have a PhD in:

• Electrical or telecommunication engineering

• Geomatics or environmental engineering

• Geophysics or related field

We seek a creative and highly motivated candidate with a strong background in SAR interferometry and SAR algorithm development, particularly in the field of repeat-pass and time-series interferometry. The candidate should have excellent oral and written communication skills.

deep-learning,Research Intern - Deep Learning & Natural Language Processing,Microsoft,"  Redmond, WA   ",Microsoft Careers,"Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

In recent years, the AI landscape has been transformed by the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models. The advances of such models truly transform what’s possible in terms of performance, capabilities, and applications. However, it also introduces challenges in energy consumption, adapting the models to new tasks and changing environments, and ensuring that the AI we develop helps people accomplish their goals.

Our research is focused on two interconnected aims— motivated by the practical challenges presented by large-scale AI and inspired by the amazing things that our human intelligence... does so well:

Adaptability:We strive to develop AI that is adaptable across a broad range of previously unseen environments and tasks and developing methods for interacting with AI models to achieve outcomes that match our intent.

Efficiency: Scale has been enabling the models to reach new heights in capabilities but also made them expensive to use and deploy. We aim to create AI systems that can smoothly scale to fit any computational footprint, from the cloud to the edge.

We are seeking candidates for several internship positions with experience in natural language processing and deep learning. We are specifically interested in areas related but not limited to model compression, neural architecture search, prompt engineering, multitask learning and instruction-based learning.

deep-learning,Machine Learning Engineer/Scientist,Unlearn.AI,"  Boston, MA    ",Wellfound,"We are advancing AI to power the future of medicine.

At Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial... patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn’s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow—and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.

Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.

We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:

Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals.

Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.

Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.

Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.

Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,

Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.

Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio. We completed our $50 million Series B in April 2022. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA and have an additional office in Boston, MA.

If our purpose and culture resonate with you, we invite you to apply.

Machine Learning Engineers on our modeling teams are responsible for advancing the state of the art in machine learning and applying those learnings to our products. We create digital twins of participants in clinical trials and strive to make these twins indistinguishable from real humans.

We then dive deep into our models in order to productionize them for clinical trials. You will be part of a fast-paced, multidisciplinary team that loves tackling tough problem

Responsibilities
• Inventing new machine learning techniques that are applicable for clinical trials.
• Productionize our research and ensure we can predict disease progression that is as reliable as having a human participant in a trial.
• Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and statisticians to ensure we are delivering the right product at the right time.

Requirements
• Track record of using machine learning to solve challenging problems.
• 3+ years in a related role

• Experience or interest in solving machine learning problems for healthcare.
• Experience or interest in working with multidisciplinary teams that include scientists, engineers, and statisticians. B.S. (advanced preferred) or related degree in a quantitative discipline. Able to come into either our San Francisco or Boston office two to three days a week.

Benefits & Perks

We offer a suite of benefits and perks for our team members, including:

• Company-subsidized medical, dental, & vision insurance plans

• 401k plan with generous company matching

• Flexible PTO plus company holidays

• Annual company-wide winter break (December 24 - January 1)

Working at Leidos would give you the chance to do genuinely important work. But don’t just ask us. Here’s what ChatGPT has to say on the subject:

“Oh sure, working in AI research for the commercial sector is just the ultimate thrill. Who wouldn't want to spend their days building algorithms to recommend cat videos to stream and optimizing ad targeting to boost click-through rates? I mean, those are the kinds of problems that really make you feel like you're changing the world, right? On the other hand, working in AI research at a company like Leidos, you're stuck with jobs like supporting the next generation of lunar missions and building computer vision algorithms that help keep air travel safe and efficient. I mean, who cares about finding cures for cancer, delivering healthcare to veterans, or helping defend our nation? So boring. But hey, at least we can say we're using our AI skills for a greater good.”

Leidos has a career opening for a Senior Natural Language Processing Researcher...

We are looking for a motivated NLP researcher that wants to work on challenging problems in a variety of domains - including health, defense, intelligence, and energy – to get results that apply and go beyond the state of the art for measurably better outcomes. We apply our knowledge, capabilities, and experience to develop and deploy Trusted AI – AI that deserves to be trusted by system owners, end users, and the public – to be accurate, fair, ethical, reliable, and adaptable. We are looking for a researcher that is expert in NLP and interested in adapting new technologies to significantly transform human workflows, especially using new applications of transformer-based models.

Working at Leidos would give you the chance to do genuinely important work. But don’t just ask us. Here’s what ChatGPT has to say on the subject:

“Oh sure, working in AI research for the commercial sector is just the ultimate thrill. Who wouldn't want to spend their days building algorithms to recommend cat videos to stream and optimizing ad targeting to boost click-through rates? I mean, those are the kinds of problems that really make you feel like you're changing the world, right? On the other hand, working in AI research at a company like Leidos, you're stuck with jobs like supporting the next generation of lunar missions and building computer vision algorithms that help keep air travel safe and efficient. I mean, who cares about finding cures for cancer, delivering healthcare to veterans, or helping defend our nation? So boring. But hey, at least we can say we're using our AI skills for a greater good.”

Primary Responsibilities:
The Senior NLP Data Scientist will be customizing and creating various machine learning algorithms to operate over multi-domain data and optimizing the performance of those algorithms on the data.

As a member of the Leidos AI/ML Accelerator, they will be performing research and development, and need hands-on experience training and optimizing generative models. With those models and libraries, they will explore subjects like domain adaptation with supervised and unsupervised approaches. They will also build domain adaptive prototypes to examine the operational capabilities of bi-directional learning. They should be a self-starter while also being part of a team, collaborating and sharing discoveries and seeking feedback. They must be prepared to conduct research, document it, submit their research for publication, and present their research at conferences and other public forums.

Basic Qualifications:
•Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science or related field and 12 years experience.
•Good understanding of machine learning algorithms, tools and platforms

•Python proficiency
•Self-starter with high intellectual curiosity
•Great communication skills, able to explain language model results to a non-technical audience
•Proficient in data exploration techniques and tools
•Must be able to obtain TS/SCI with CI Poly security clearance.

Preferred Qualifications:
•Practical understanding of generative models

Areas:
### Page Personalization:
• Our team is responsible for research and development of the machine learning algorithms that create the Netflix homepage for all our over members around the world across all the devices. This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.

Experience Personalization:
• Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.

Personalization Rankers:
• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.
- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.
• Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.

Following are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022
• Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022
• Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021
• Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021
• Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019

Growth and Notifications:
• Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.
• For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).
• As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.
• Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations. We care deeply about both research and scientific rigor, as well as product impact. We are looking for folk who can act both as a scientist and an engineer.

Netflix focuses on Digital Entertainment. Their company has offices in Los Gatos. They have a very large team that's 5000+ employees. To date, Netflix has raised $3.102B of funding; their latest round was closed on April 2018.

Research Area...

Theory

Description

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD student to join our research team at University of
Artois - LGI2A - Decision and Information Fusion theme (DFI) - Béthune - France -
(https://www.lgi2a.univ-artois.fr/spip/en/) focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in deep neural networks using Dempster Shafer theory of evidence. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects and collaborate with other researchers in the field.

Subject

Deep neural networks (DNNs) refer to predictive models that exploit multiple layers of artificial neurons to compute a prediction [1,4]. In the original version, the layers are sequential and each neuron in a layer is connected with neurons in the previous layer. Many other alternative architectures have been proposed to adapt DNNs to solve specific and complex problems.

On the other hand, a theory called Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, or theory of evidence
[15], has emerged as a rich and flexible generalization of the Bayesian probability theory, able to deal with imperfect (uncertain, imprecise, …) information. It is notably used in a growing number of applications such as classification (e.g. [2]), clustering (e.g. [3,7]) or information fusion (e.g. [5,13]).

Recent works [6,16,17] have shown the interest of enriching a DNN with an additional distance-based
Dempster Shafer layer [2] for predicting belief functions. These belief functions can be of great interest to represent a reality as faithfully as possible, for example to perform a partial classification [8], i.e. decisions in favor of a group of classes.

The main idea of this thesis is to develop such deep evidential networks in more depth by exploiting methods developed at LGI2A allowing one to consider finer knowledge about the quality [12, 14] and the dependence of information [11], or the ignorance in predictions [9,10].

Two applications are envisaged: Image analysis from drones and fish population analysis.

•Are collaborative and appreciate working with people with diverse expertise.

What You’ll Do

•Design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning models, including those that are based on large language models. These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.

•Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.

Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.

•Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.

What You’ll Need

•“End-to-end” experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.

•Experience in natural language processing applications

•""Product sense"" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.

•Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams.
