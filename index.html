            <p>
              The job market for data science and analytics has been booming in recent years, with companies in a variety of industries looking to use data-driven insights to make informed business decisions. At the same time, there are many students and job seekers who are looking for jobs every year. Therefore, an analysis of the hiring needs of this industry is necessary to provide insights to those preparing for a career in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, two datasets on job postings obtained through a web crawler exercise will be explored. This project aims to extract meaningful insights from the dataset through data visualization, such as current hiring locations and required skills for positions. Ultimately, the project hopes to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current data science and analytics job market and to keep job seekers and employers up-to-date on the latest trends and opportunities in this exciting field.            </p>

          About the Data
        </h2>
        <p style="width: 80%;">
          In this project, we explore two datasets that represent the entire United States and the District of Columbia, respectively. Together, they contain approximately 850 job postings related to data science, analytics, and related fields, obtained through web crawling exercises and active as of April 14, 2023. The first step in performing data analysis is to clean these datasets. Therefore, I first selected the necessary information such as job title, company name, location, description, etc., and cleaned up the two datasets separately. Besides these two datasets, I got a third one by merging these two.  More details about the datasets are presented in the "Methods" section. The next step is to further analyze the data by visualizing three different datasets.

        <center><p style="font-size: 0.85rem; width: 89%"> Figure 1: The symbol map is made by Tableau that visualizes the distribution of hiring for data science and related careers across the United States. The size of the dots on the map represents the number of job openings in a given location, while the colors are used to represent different regions. Based on the map, it can be seen that companies in California, New York, and Washington have a higher number of job openings compared to other regions in the US. 
        </p></center>
        <p>
          To gain insights into the overall job market for data science-related jobs, we used the Tableau Symbolic Map, a powerful visualization tool that helps to highlight geographic trends in hiring. This visualization allows us to easily see the distribution of job openings across the US, with the size of the dots representing the number of available jobs and the colors representing the different regions. Understanding general trends in the data science job market can provide us with valuable insights that will inform our analysis of specific job postings later in the project. By identifying regions with the most job openings, we can determine which areas of the country may have the most competitive job markets and which regions may offer job seekers the best opportunities. Analyzing Figure 1, we can see that California and New York have the most job openings overall, indicating that these regions are likely the most fertile ground for job seekers in data science. Thus, job seekers can focus on these regions to increase their chances of finding the best job opportunities.

            Now that we have a general understanding of which regions in the United States have the most openings for data science-related careers, the next step is to identify the specific companies that are currently hiring. Analyzing the company names in a clean data set of all job postings can help us identify the top companies with the most job openings. By doing so, job seekers can focus their job search on companies that are actively hiring for data science positions, increasing their chances of finding relevant job opportunities.

The size of each rectangle represents the number of job postings available at each company, with Upwork having the highest number of job openings among all companies.  
          </p></center>
          <p>
            To analyze and identify the specific companies that are currently hiring, we utilized the treemap visualization in Tableau. This visualization tool allows us to compare the number of job openings at different companies by displaying the size of each rectangle proportionally to the number of job postings. By examining the treemap, we can easily see which companies have the most data science job openings, and job seekers can focus their job search on these companies. As depicted in Figure 2, Upwork has the most job postings, far ahead of other companies. However, it's important to note that many other companies are also actively recruiting for data science-related positions and offer a wide range of job openings. Therefore, job seekers should not limit themselves to just one or two companies but should rather explore multiple job opportunities at different companies to increase their chances of finding a suitable job.

            <p>
              Many job seekers who are considering a career in data science often wonder about the expected salary for this profession. To answer this question, we analyzed salary data from various job postings and created a box plot graph using Plotly (Figure 4). This graph allowed us to compare salary average ranges for different types of data science jobs and identify any differences in salaries between positions.
            </p> 
            <p>
              After analyzing the box plot graph, we observed that data analyst positions typically have lower salaries compared to other similar roles. This is likely because data analyst positions are often entry-level roles that require less experience and expertise than other data science jobs. Conversely, jobs related to machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks, and natural language processing tend to have higher average salaries than other data science jobs. This is because these roles require more specialized skills and experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Furthermore, the box plot graph shows that there is a wide range of salaries for each type of data science job. This can be attributed to various factors, such as years of experience, specific skills, and industry. Therefore, job seekers should conduct thorough research on job opportunities and salaries within their field of interest. Overall, this analysis and visualization of salary data can be a valuable resource for job seekers considering a career in data science. By understanding the salary ranges for different types of data science jobs, job seekers can better evaluate job opportunities and negotiate salaries to secure a more fulfilling and financially rewarding career.            </p>
